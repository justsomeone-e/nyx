# Nyx v4 Syntax and Semantic Contract

Status: `v4.0.0-dev.2` (`Maya`) development contract.

This file defines the compatibility boundary for Nyx source. The readable
examples live in [`../LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md`](../LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md). The
machine-readable keyword and target contracts live in
`src/core/language_surface.py` and `src/core/backend_capabilities.py`.

## 1. Source and lexical rules

- Source files use UTF-8 and the `.nyx` extension.
- Whitespace separates tokens but is otherwise insignificant.
- A semicolon is optional after a complete statement.
- `//` starts a line comment and `///` starts a documentation comment.
- Identifiers are case-sensitive.
- Strings support `\\`, `\"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\0`, and `\uXXXX` escapes.
- Unicode normalization is never implicit.

The stable v4 surface contains 43 keywords. Their exact grouping and editor
order are generated from `STABLE_KEYWORD_GROUPS`; editor completion is required
to match that contract exactly. The pre-v4 `def` alias is not a keyword;
function declarations use only `fn`.

## 2. Grammar outline

The following EBNF is a compact compatibility outline. Parser conformance is
proved by exact Python/Nyx AST parity tests.

```ebnf
program          = { item | statement } EOF ;

item             = function | struct | trait | implementation | enum
                 | type_alias | extern_function | import | native_directive
                 | test_block ;

function         = [ "async" ] "fn" identifier [ generic_parameters ]
                   "(" [ parameters ] ")" [ "->" type ]
                   ( block | "=" expression [ ";" ] ) ;
trait_method     = [ "async" ] "fn" identifier [ generic_parameters ]
                   "(" [ parameters ] ")" [ "->" type ] ;
struct           = "struct" identifier [ generic_parameters ]
                   "{" [ fields ] "}" ;
trait            = "trait" identifier "{" { trait_method } "}" ;
implementation   = "impl" identifier [ "for" identifier ]
                   "{" { function } "}" ;

statement        = declaration | assignment | expression
                 | if_statement | for_statement | while_statement
                 | loop_statement | match_statement | try_statement
                 | guard_statement | defer_statement | unsafe_block
                 | spawn_block | return_statement | throw_statement
                 | break_statement | continue_statement ;

declaration      = ( "var" | "let" | "const" ) identifier
                   [ ":" type ] "=" expression ;
assignment       = [ "set" ] assignable "=" expression ;
if_statement     = "if" expression block
                   { ( "elif" expression | "else" "if" expression ) block }
                   [ "else" block ] ;
for_statement    = "for" identifier "in" expression block ;
while_statement  = "while" expression block ;
loop_statement   = "loop" block ;
try_statement    = "try" block "catch" identifier block ;
throw_statement  = "throw" expression ;

expression       = pipeline | if_expression | match_expression ;
if_expression    = "if" expression value_block
                   { ( "elif" expression | "else" "if" expression ) value_block }
                   "else" value_block ;
match_expression = "match" expression "{"
                   { literal "=>" value_expression "," }
                   "_" "=>" value_expression [ "," ] "}" ;
value_expression = expression | value_block ;
value_block      = "{" expression [ ";" ] "}" ;
pipeline         = null_coalesce { "|>" call_target } ;
null_coalesce    = logical_or { "??" logical_or } ;
unary            = ( "!" | "not" | "-" | "+" | "~" | "await" ) unary
                 | postfix ;
postfix          = primary { call | member | safe_member | index } ;
```

Operator precedence, from tightest to loosest, is postfix, unary,
multiplicative, additive, shifts, comparisons, equality, bitwise AND/XOR/OR,
logical AND/OR, null coalescing, then pipeline.

## 3. Binding contract

- `var` creates a rebindable binding.
- `let` and `const` create non-rebindable bindings.
- Binding immutability is shallow. It does not imply a recursively immutable
  object graph or a C++-style const receiver.
- `set x = value` and `x = value` have the same assignment semantics. `set` is
  the preferred explicit spelling.
- HIR verification, rather than target-language syntax, enforces rebinding.
- Trait methods are bodyless signatures. Trait implementations must name a
  declared trait and struct, provide `self` first, and exactly match every
  required method's async marker, value-parameter types, and return type.
- Inherent implementations may also declare associated functions without
  `self`; only methods called on an instance declare `self` first.

## 4. Type and control-flow contract

- `int` has the canonical signed 64-bit hosted representation.
- `float` has the canonical IEEE-754 binary64 hosted representation.
- `i8/i16/i32/i64`, `u8/u16/u32/u64`, and `f32/f64` select concrete storage
  widths on declaring native and Rust backends. Literal narrowing is
  rejected before code generation.
- Source integer literals are restricted to
  `-9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807`; `E2012` rejects any other
  magnitude before HIR lowering. Direct negation of decimal or hexadecimal 2⁶³
  forms the minimum value.
- Signed integer overflow wraps modulo 2⁶⁴; it never invokes target-language
  undefined behavior or loses precision through a JavaScript `Number`.
- Integer division truncates toward zero. Remainder has the dividend's sign.
  Shift counts are masked to six bits.
- Floating division follows IEEE-754 binary64, including infinities and NaN.
  Floating `%` is the truncating `fmod` operation.
- Canonical numeric string conversion is target-independent: `nan`, `inf`,
  `-inf`, no exponent zero-padding, and negative zero rendered as `0`.
- Canonical boolean text is lowercase `true` or `false`.
- Implicit `int` to `float` widening performs binary64 conversion at the use
  boundary and never rewrites the source binding's type. No implicit `float`
  to `int` narrowing exists.
- Constant folding uses these same rules, including i64 wrap, masked shifts,
  truncating division, and mixed-number widening. Optimization cannot change a
  program's numeric result.
- `cpp`, `js`, and `python` advertise `int64_wrap`, `float64_ieee`, and
  `canonical_scalar_text`. `wasm` remains a beta `wasm32` numeric contract.
- Conditions require `bool`; implicit truthiness is not part of v4. A value
  whose type remains `any` is checked at the condition boundary and raises a
  runtime type error unless its actual value is exactly Boolean.
- `a..b` is inclusive at both ends.
- `break` and `continue` require an enclosing loop.
- `return` requires an enclosing function and must match its declared result.
- `fn name(...) -> T = expression` is exactly one implicit return; it does not
  change return typing or evaluation order.
- An `if` used as an expression requires `else`, every arm produces one value,
  and arm types must agree (with the normal `int` to `float` widening rule).
- A value-producing `match` supports literal arms and must end with exactly one
  `_` fallback. Its arm values have the same type-unification rule as an
  if-expression. Its subject is evaluated exactly once before pattern
  comparisons, including calls and other side-effecting expressions.
- Statement `match` remains the pattern-binding form for `Ok(value)`,
  `Err(error)`, and other action-oriented arms.
- `guard condition else { ... }` executes its else body when the condition is
  false; that body is expected to leave the guarded path.
- `defer expression` executes once when its lexical scope exits, including an
  exit caused by return or a propagated exception.

## 5. Task contract

- Calling `async fn f(...) -> T` produces `Task<T>`.
- `await value` is valid only in an async function.
- The operand of `await` must be `Task<T>` and the expression type is `T`.
- A task represents one shared completion and may be awaited repeatedly.
- Success values and thrown errors are replayed consistently to every awaiter.
- Task start timing is unspecified; code must not depend on eager versus deferred
  scheduling.
- Cancellation and structured-concurrency ownership are not part of RC1.

`cpp`, `js`, and `python` implement this contract respectively with a shared
future, a Promise, and a reusable wrapper around one `asyncio.Task`.

## 6. Exception contract

- `throw expression` transfers control to the nearest matching `catch`.
- The caught value uses Nyx's canonical string conversion at the exception
  boundary.
- An uncaught error terminates the top-level task/program with failure.
- Exceptions cross `Task<T>` at `await`; they are not converted to success
  values.

Exceptions and tasks are capability-gated. A backend without the feature must
emit `E3001` before code generation.

## 7. HIR authority

The source frontend lowers to immutable typed HIR v1. A backend may only consume
verified HIR for a stable designation. The verifier owns:

- symbol identity and declaration-before-use;
- type compatibility and callable arity;
- immutable-binding checks;
- loop, return, await, and assignment placement;
- HIR schema and structural validity.

Backend-specific source rewrites or silent feature approximations are forbidden.
Unsupported behavior must be rejected through the versioned capability registry.

## 8. Compatibility rule

After RC1, existing valid v4 source cannot change meaning within the v4 line.
New syntax must be additive, have exact Python/Nyx frontend parity, lower to
target-neutral HIR, and either pass runtime parity on every declaring backend or
be rejected by an explicit capability gate.

## 9. Language evolution rule

Microcontroller and freestanding firmware targets are not part of the active
v4 language contract. The former `volatile`, `interrupt`, `critical`,
`Buffer<T, N>`, and `buffer_ptr` surface has been removed from both frontends.
A future fixed-size collection must be target-neutral and enter through a new
syntax RFC.

New syntax must introduce a distinct, testable semantic operation. Alias
keywords that only duplicate an existing spelling are rejected. Every accepted
syntax RFC requires Python/Nyx frontend parity, type-checker coverage, canonical
HIR lowering, structured negative diagnostics, and backend capability tests.
